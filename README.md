# odin-recipes
This website is my first Odin Project. The website is HTML only and will later be styled with CSS. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. CSS stands for Casscading Style Sheets. This website was originally created on github and cloned via git to my local machine. Uplon completion of this project I will commit it to my Github. This will be a recipe for Lasagna.
